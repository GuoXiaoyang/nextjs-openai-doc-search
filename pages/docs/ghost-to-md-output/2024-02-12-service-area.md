Mobile grooming businesses require flexible and precise management of their operations in service areas. MoeGo's Service Area setting is specifically for the mobile grooming industry, which allows you to seamlessly establish distinct service areas and utilize them for various operational aspects such as setting Certain areas for Certain days, Online Booking, and client management.

## Adding a Service Area

Before leveraging your service area for shift management or online booking, you need to add it to your service area list.

## Certain Areas for Certain Days (CACD)

CACD (Certain Area for Certain Days) setting can help you to control available regions for different dates so you can adopt [Smart Scheduling](__GHOST_URL__/06-create-new-from-smart-scheduling/) without considering the service area change. You can also[ set up CACD for Online Booking](__GHOST_URL__/online-booking-for-mobile-grooming/) so that customers from a certain area can only request certain dates from Online Bookings. 

### From Desktop 🖥️

If your staff members have a regular CACD pattern for their shifts, you can set up the service areas based on their shift patterns using the desktop version. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to **Settings > Staff > Shift Management.**
- Switch to list view.
- Click on the target staff member to add service areas to their shift.
