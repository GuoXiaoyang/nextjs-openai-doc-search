## **‚ùì Frequently asked question**

**Q1. Is it safe to save card info on MoeGo?**

Answer: The card info will be saved on the current primary payment processor. Rest assured that MoeGo prioritizes the highest standards of security and compliance, employing robust encryption protocols and adhering to industry regulations.

**Q2. Can I send the same link to all clients or put the link on my website?**

Answer: The secured link is unique to each client. Please do not share it with other clients, or other's cards will be saved for the same client.

**Q3. Can I transfer the card info saved to another processor?**

Answer: Since the card info is encrypted by each processor, it is not possible to transfer the card info.

**Q4. For Online Booking: If I switch from one processor to another, will the Card on File requirement for Online Booking prompt existing customers to input a new card again?**

Answer: Yes, it will require customers to input a new card.

Please note that **the cards saved on MoeGo Pay will not be applied to charge through another processor** since the card info is safely encrypted by each processor.

**Q5. Is there any area limitations for the card-on-file feature?**

Answer: It is only available for those areas that support the payment processor. While Stripe is available in the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia, card-on-file is supported in these areas.

But for the UK users who enable card authorization, the card may fail to be saved due to the 3DS issue. Click [here](__GHOST_URL__/moego-pay-card-authentication/) to know more details about it.

**Q6. Can a client add another card if they have an existing card on file through the Intake Form?**

The new card won't be added if there is already an existing card on file.
