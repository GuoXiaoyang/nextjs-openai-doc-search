## Fake it filter

Fake it filter can make your business look more "busy" so clients will be more eager to book the "remaining" slots. 

 Set up your availability as :

- **Off** - Do not apply any filters to your availability
- **Slightly busy** - take off 25% of your openings
- **Moderately busy** - take off 40% of your openings
- **Extremely busy** - take off 50% of your openings
