CTAs:

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: Can users revert back if they upgrade to 3.0 landing page?**

A: **They can’**t. Because this process contains data merge, the revert-back entry will be taken down once they upgrade successfully. Based on the current user data of online booking 3.0, we are confident enough to take this step. (If there is a special case that needs to revert back, CS can reach @Gianna for help)
