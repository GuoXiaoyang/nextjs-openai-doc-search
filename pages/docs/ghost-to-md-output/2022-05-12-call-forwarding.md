> Your all-in-one solution for client communication!

You might have heard about one of the MoeGo star features, 2-way message. In our 2-way message center, you can easily keep all your conversations in just one place. It largely facilitates the communication flow and links everything together. 

Now we've even made one more step for the MoeGo phone number, supporting call service as well. Other than messaging your clients, the call to this number can be forwarded to other numbers that work for you. 

**MoeGo phone number auto call response** can either forward the call to your business line, or set up an auto-reply message to let your customer know what to expect. Therefore, the whole communication would be smoother and you don't have to worry about missing any potential customers. 

## How to set up:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Go to **MoeGo Phone Number**
3. Turn on **Call forwading** and set the number
4. Turn on **Reply message** and set the template
