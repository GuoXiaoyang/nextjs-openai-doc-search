## 2) Applying the service charges when checking out

Service charges are added per appointment and each service charge can only be added once to a single appointment.

### Automatically adding the service charges

If you turn on **<Automatically apply during checkout> **when configuring your service charges, they will be added to the appointment upon checkout.

### Manually adding the service charges

If you turn off <**Automatically apply during checkout> **when configuring your service charges, they will not be added to the appointment automatically upon checkout, and you will need to manually choose which service charge to be added to the invoice.

When checking out, click on **<Add service charges>** to select which service charge to apply to the invoice.
