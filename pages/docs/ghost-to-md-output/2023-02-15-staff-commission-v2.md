**How does the tier commission affect the payroll reporting?**

**Sliding scale: **
The percentage will be applied to the entire total of services in the reporting period.
For example, If the staff's collected service is 150, which belongs to tier 2. The commission by tier is 150 x 45%(Tier2)=67.5

**Progressive:**
The percentage gets applied to each tier individually.
For example, Staff's collected service is 150, which belongs to tier 2. The commission by tier is  100 x 40%(Tier1) + (150 - 100) x 45%(Tier2) = 100 x 40% + 50 x 45% = 40 + 22.5 = 62.5

**How does the commission for service affect the payroll reporting?**

The total commission is calculated by giving preference to the commission rate for service.

For example, if the commission rate for a service is set to 0% for all employees, then even if the employee provides the service, he will not get the commission; if the commission rate for a service is set to 60% for all employees, then even if the employee's own service commission rate is 50%, as long as he provides the service, it will calculate the commission income at the rate of 70%.
