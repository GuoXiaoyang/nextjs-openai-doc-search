Technology is supposed to eliminate the tedious work so you can do what you love.

The offering in the market, they are either not tailored for pet industry, or not smart enough to avoid conflicts, Â according to groomer working hours, dogs breed, weight, time since last groom

Here are the main problems we have heard from many business owners when thinking about offering online booking:

> - My groomers' working hours are very different
> - My groomers have different conditions, some can not do large dogs 
> - My shop book differently than others, we do by number of dogs drop off certain time
> - My clients always pick the small dog services while the dog is actually large 
> - I'm not accepting new clients anymore, only existing clients 
> - I don't want my clients have the wrong expectation that they have the time and date booked
> - mobile grooming specific, I don't want to drive all around the city, I cannot have my client pick the date, I have to do it on my own with the best route 

At MoeGo, we've build the 24/7 Smart Online Booking to solve all these problems above. 

Feature explained in a nutshell: 

1. **Booking request**: Once customer submit a booking request, you can decide to "Schedule" or "Move to waitlist" or "Decline". Your customers know it's a booking request that requires your approval upon submission, through message and email. 
2. **Availability control**: 
- Book by working hours, you can accept booking request to avoid double booking with this option. Each staff can have different working hours. Or simply block the time on the calendar to make certain time not available for your customers to book. 
- **Book by slots**, you can set up certain amount of pets on certain time. For instance, 10 dogs at 9AM, and 10 dogs at 1PM. 
3. **Service control:**
- Service by breed & weight: eliminate booking errors with the available services filtered by pet breed and weight 
- Certain service available for online booking
- Price for different pets varies, you can better manage expectation with "show price" options, either "Do not show price", "Show fixed service price", "show price with 'starting at'", or show price as "varies". 
4. **Staff preference**:
- You can customize service hours for each staff
- You can set up if certain service can only be done by certain staff member
- If your shop only take small dogs, you can simply set up "**weight limit**" to avoid unnecessary bookings Â 
5. **Accept pet type control:**
- So yes, if your business only do cats, then just select "cat" only. You can choose either Dog, Cat or Other animals; or accept all of them.
6. **Accept client type control:**
- Choose to accept "Existing Clients only", or "New Clients only", or both.
- You can even block out certain clients from booking online.
7. **Require to sign agreement **
8. **Require to put card on file to prevent no-show**

No more booking errors, automate your bookings, accept 24/7 booking requests in full control. ðŸ™Œ
