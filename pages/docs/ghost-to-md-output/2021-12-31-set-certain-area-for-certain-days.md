The certain areas for certain day settings can help mobile groomers control available regions for different dates so that customers from a certain area can only request certain dates via online bookings.  It is a great option for multi-van management so that you can organize routes with certain areas for certain vans.

## How to Set up

### Select an existing area for a groomer

- On MoeGo App, Go to **Settings > Set certain area for certain days.**
- Choose the groomer from the top right corner of the calendar.
- Click on the date, select the area, and click **< Apply >**.

### Add a new area to the area list

There are two ways to add an area to the area list. You can do it by drawing on the map or using zipcodes from the business setting of the desktop version. See the guide here: [Service Area for Mobile Grooming ](__GHOST_URL__/service-area/)

The other way is adding directly from the App: 

- From the area list, scroll down and select **< Add a new area >**.
- Click the search button and search for the location. Click **< Confirm >**.
- Draw the area from the location by clicking on the map and adding pinpoints to the area edges.
- Click **< Next > ** and you can add a name or choose a color code for the new service area.
- Click **< Add >** to add the service area to the area list.
