## Frequently asked question

**Q1. Which card processor does it support?**

It currently supports Stripe as the primary card processor.

Please note that **the cards saved on MoeGo Pay will not be applied to charge through another processor** since the card info is safely encrypted by each processor.

**Q2. Is there any area limitation on card-on-file requests?**

Generally, there are no area limits. But for the EU users including the UK users, the authorization on certain cards may fail due to the 3DS issue. So it is not possible to save card on files for these cards.

**Q3. Can I send the same link to all clients or put the link on my website?**

The secured link is unique to each client. Please do not share it with other clients, or otherâ€™s cards will be saved to the same client.
