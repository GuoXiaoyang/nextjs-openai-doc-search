### POS

**MoeGo Pay **is your point-of-sale (also known as POS) system. It will calculate your customer's total service amount, add tax, add additional fees, and (securely) process the payment. This is all within your MoeGo account so you do not need to do anything manually. 

### Prepayment/Deposit

**[MoeGo Prepayment ](prepayment)**is a feature that allows businesses to secure payment for service upon booking. This helps merchants lock in future revenue in advance.

With prepayment or deposits, customers must pay a deposit or even the total amount before submitting an online booking request. Everything is customizable so you can choose what is best for your business. 

When a customer submits the booking and pays the prepaid amount, the payment will be frozen in the client's bank account. Once the business accepts the booking request, the prepaid amount will be transferred to the business' bank account.

This feature allows businesses to receive the deposit or even the full amount as soon as the appointment is accepted.

### 
Card on File

Saving a [card on file](__GHOST_URL__/moego-card-on-file/) has become a norm for pet businesses. It guarantees that you still earn your revenue when last-minute cancellations and no-shows happen, and on the other hand, ensures a faster checkout experience for both you and your clients. With MoeGo Pay it's easy for you to update your 'card on file' status and one-click request! You can require this for all of your customers, whether they are new or existing. 

### Smart Tips

With MoeGo Pay you cannot only customized tipping settings, but you can also optimize your tip revenue by enabling flexible tip rates based on ticket prices. [Smart Tips](__GHOST_URL__/smart-tip/) enables you to customize 3 default tipping options and highlight the preferred one on the customer end. What makes it SMART is that tipping options can change with ticket prices. Present tips by percentage for higher ticket prices, and by a fixed amount for lower ones, or use your own creativity there!

- Customize tips by rate or amount
- Customize preferred rate or amount
- Customize 2 sets of tips rate with a threshold

*(Estimated 20% increase of your regular tips revenue ðŸ˜„)*

### 
Processing Fee by client

The [processing fee](__GHOST_URL__/add-a-convenience-fee-for-credit-card-payments/) can be easily added to the invoice at checkout in MoeGo with MoeGo Pay. It consists of two parts, a percentage and a fixed amount for each transaction, both of which can be passed to the client's side. Once configured the fee rate, the exact fees will be calculated for transactions automatically and ready to be applied at checkout.

This may not be applicable depending on where you are located. Please check your state's rules and regulations. 

### 
Send invoice

With MoeGo Pay you are able to send the final invoice to your customer. This is simply done in the messaging center or directly on the appointment. The customer will get a link that directs them to a web page where they can enter their credit card information to pay the applicable bill. 

### 
Integrated Card Reader

If you want to take credit card payments in person, we also have card readers that are integrated with MoeGo Pay. You are able to integrate a c[ard reader or a touchscreen card reader](https://www.moego.shop/), whichever you prefer. 

###
