## Three ways to get signature and credit card info from clients

There are several ways to send a cancelation policy to clients so they can sign it and provide credit card info.

### 1️⃣ Send through online booking

During online booking, you can ask clients to provide credit card info and sign your cancellation policy.

Check [here](__GHOST_URL__/require-credit-card-for-online-booking/) for details.

### 2️⃣ Send through the intake form

Just like online booking, you can also include a cancellation policy in your intake form.
