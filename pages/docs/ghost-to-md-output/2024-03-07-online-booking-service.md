### Only Show Applicable Services for Online Booking (optional)

When the toggle is activated, clients will only see and be able to book services and add-ons that are suitable for their pet's specific characteristics, such as weight, type, breed, or coat type, which are defined in the previous step.

For instance, let's consider the service 'Full service - small,' designed for breeds weighing between 1 and 10 pounds, including those with short or double coats. In this scenario, the service would be available for Kiki, an Akita weighing 6 pounds with a short coat, but not for Joey, an Asbash weighing 8 pounds with a long coat.

This feature ensures that clients do not mistakenly book inappropriate services for their pets, while also safeguarding groomers' revenue by ensuring that services are appropriately matched to the pet's needs.

To activate the toggle to only show applicable services, you can:

1. Go to **< Online booking >** and select **< Settings >** from the top right of the screen
2. Select **< Service >**
3. Switch on the **< Only show applicable services and add-ons on booking page toggle >**
