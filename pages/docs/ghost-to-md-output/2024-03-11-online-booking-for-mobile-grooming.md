MoeGo Online Booking is a powerful tool that streamlines mobile grooming operations. It offers Smart Scheduling to manage available dates and times, and automated checks to ensure clients fall within your service area. Set certain areas for certain days to optimize routes for multi-van conditions.

## **How to Set Up**

Go to **Online Bookings > Settings > Mobile Grooming**

### **1) Automated Checks to Verify if a Client Falls Within Your Service Area**

Turn on **<Require address >**. By turning it on, only customers in your service area can submit an online booking request.

You can use the pre-set service area list to limit the service area for your Online Booking site. To add a service area to your online booking, simply:

1. Go to **< Online booking > **and select** < Settings >**
2. Select** < Mobile grooming >**
3. Navigate to the Service area section and select **< Add service area > **to enable that service area for online booking clients.

You can see[ this guide ](__GHOST_URL__/service-area/) to see how to add a new service area to your service area list.

- By ticking **< If the client is not within the service area, allow the customer to submit a request without date and time >**, the customerâ€™s request out of your service area will appear in the booking request list without date and time. You can reach out to them via phone or text to further discuss the appointments.
- By ticking **< If an existing client changed address, or the service area changed, existing clients can still submit a request >**, the existing clients' request will not be affected by your service area setting.

### **2) Set Up Smart Scheduling for Mobile Grooming Online Booking**

Smart scheduling aims to assist you in finding an available time slot for an appointment so that the new appointment is always close enough to an existing one, enhancing the efficiency of your scheduling.

By turning on the **<Smart Scheduling button>**, a customer can only book an available time slot based on your route, so that the location is within the maximum driving distance or time between appointments.

## FAQ

**Q1. Why my client seeing no availability in next 2 month when selecting staff while I have plenty of slots available?  **

Answer: This might be due to that the client's address cannot be fit in to your schedule with the Smart scheduling parameter you've set. The system will recommend slot to client if the address can fulfill **1 of the 4** parameter of maximum driving time/distance from last appointment/ next appointment (start/end location).
