## FAQ

**Q1. What information will be merged when a client resubmits the intake form?**

Answer: By merging, conflicts will be overridden and new information will be added to the existing profile. New pets will be added as an additional pet profile. After you elect to **< check existing profile >** from the form submission, there will be a pop up that will visualize for you the new information and conflicting information.
