**Q: Is the subscription charged monthly or annually?**

Monthly. We know the challenges that a new business faces at an early stage, so MoeGo will charge the subscription monthly and help you get through the first year.

**Q: Will my annual contract renew after the initial year?**

The annual contract will only be effective for 12 months from the date you sign it.  After the initial year, your subscription will be auto renewed monthly unless the service is canceled.
