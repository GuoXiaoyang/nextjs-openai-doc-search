We are thrilled to introduce our new Abandoned Booking for Online Booking, designed to help you reconnect with potential clients who couldn't complete an online booking and facilitate the recovery of these bookings! 

For the customers who visited your booking site but failed to submit booking requests for different reasons, now you can recover them at your fingertips. You can easily assist with their booking via call or message with their pre-filled info, directly schedule appointments for them, regularly track your recovery performance, identify trends, and optimize strategies to enhance booking recovery over time.

It's great for businesses that are actively growing their client base without wasting marketing spending.

## 5. How to win back the customerðŸ’¡

### Schedule Recovery Message

The Schedule Recovery Message is a powerful tool to help you send scheduled, personalized two-way messages to your site visitors who almost became your customers. This feature helps you seamlessly deliver tailored communication and assistance to clients who may have trouble completing the booking.  Once enabled, the system will automatically add site visitors who responded to your client list.

Because of the proactive nature of this communication, these will count as **two-way messages **and will be spent from your SMS credits. 

To set up a scheduled message, there are a few simple steps:

- Go to **Online booking > Abandon bookings**
- Click the** < Schedule recovery message >** button
- Enable schedule recovery message

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-18-at-11.50.26-1.gif)
- Specify the following details: 
- New visitors or Existing clients
- Step(s) of abandonment
- Scheduled time of message delivery
- Your message content

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-18-at-11.59.08.gif)
Please note that the Schedule Recovery Messages will only be sent to clients who have the status of **< Abandoned >**. You may only send a Scheduled Recovery Message once to clients with the Abandoned status, after which their status will change to **< Contacted >**. 
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-18-at-11.53.43.png)
Example 1: If you have set the send-out time at **2 hours after abandoned**, it means that the message will be sent 2 hours after the last abandonment of all of your clients who have the **< Abandon > **status. 

Example 2: If you have set the send-out time **every day at 9 am**, it means that the message will be sent out daily at 9 am to all clients who have the** < Abandon > **status.
