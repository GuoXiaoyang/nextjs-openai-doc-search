## Troubleshooting available time

The online booking available time slots are defined by a set of settings: 

- Staff available time is not available, or there is no staff for certain services
- Closed dates
- Closed holiday
- Blocked time on the calendar 
- Existing appointments on the calendar
- If you are a mobile groomer and turned on "**smart scheduling**", the availability will also be defined by your smart scheduling parameter setting, as well as how far the new appointment to your existing appointments 
- If you are a mobile groomer and turned on "**certain area for certain dates**", the availability will also be defined by your settings of certain areas for certain dates. If you are not going to a certain area, that date will not be available for your customers to select from
