MoeGo's Online Booking system is where simplicity meets flexibility in managing client payments. With **Payment Requirements **and **Customized Payment Options by Clients**, our payment system is designed to cater to the diverse needs of your business.

## Setting General Payment Requirements

Our Online Booking payments feature empowers you to set payment requirements that suit your preferences and business needs. The methods include the following: 

- **Prepayment / Deposit**: Requiring clients to pay up to the full amount of your service fee when submitting booking requests. [Learn more here](__GHOST_URL__/moego-prepayment/),
- **MoeGo Pay Pre-auth**: Requiring a valid card on file upon booking. The card will be pre-authorized for the client's ticket amount 24 hours before the appointment, safeguarding revenue and reducing no-shows. [Learn more here](__GHOST_URL__/moego-pay-pre-authorization/).
- **Card on File**: Requiring your clients to input valid credit **cards on file** when submitting booking requests. [Learn more here](__GHOST_URL__/5-ways-to-add-cards-on-file/).
- **No Payment**: Clients can directly submit bookings without payment required.

### Setup Steps

Go to **Online Booking > Settings > Payment > Payment requirement**, and select the required payment method of your choice to be applied to all clients.
