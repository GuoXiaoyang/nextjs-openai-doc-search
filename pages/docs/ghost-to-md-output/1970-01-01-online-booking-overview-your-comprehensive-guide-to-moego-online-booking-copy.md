Online booking in MoeGo is a powerful tool that allows your clients to view your service and submit appointment requests with you. It consists of a storefront website and a book appointment flow. If you're curious to see what our online booking looks like, be sure to check out the demo page [**here**](https://booking.moego.pet/ol/landing?name=CrazyCutePetSpa). 

This guide is structured into four core sections to provide you with a complete understanding of the platform:

**Setting Up Online Booking Landing Page**: Learn how to set up your own business page and create an impressive online presence with MoeGo's customizable storefront page.

**Navigating the Online Booking Flow**: See what clients will experience during the booking process. It also explains how to set up the booking flow, including the necessary input info, agreements, and payment requirements.

**Managing Booking Requests**: Find where and how to review, accept, or decline requests. Feel free to explore the automation settings that can streamline business operations. Additionally, discover how to check abandoned bookings and how to win them back. 

**Online Booking Integrations**: Enhance the booking managing experience with integrated features and third-party tools designed to make your operations smoother and more efficient.

## **1. Online Booking Landing Page**

Your business's digital storefront begins with a customizable landing page, which serves as the entrance to your business's online booking page. This page provides a space to showcase your brand, services, and other general info. Additionally, a "Book Now" button is available to allow customers to initiate the booking process. 

To learn how to set it up and integrate it into your business website, visit: [Learn how to set up your Landing Page](__GHOST_URL__/online-booking-landing-page/).

## **2. Online Booking Flow**

When a new customer goes to the booking page, they go through the following process to submit their booking request, please take the attachment as a reference.  

Existing clients need their phone numbers on file to receive the verification code, then enter the code to login. Once logged in, they can submit the requests without going through the whole process of filling up the information.

### Step 3: Select service and staff

If you need to restrict some of the services and add-ons available for online booking, and only allow certain staff members to be booked for specific services, you can customize your service menus to meet the unique needs of your business and customers. Visit [Online Booking Service](__GHOST_URL__/online-booking-service/) to learn how to do this.

### Step 4: Select an available time slot

We provide a variety of availability settings to enhance your online booking experience, giving you the flexibility to meet your business needs and operational rhythm. This is especially important as more businesses have their own ways of managing appointments. Check out our guide on how to set your [Online Booking Availability](__GHOST_URL__/online-booking-availability/) by working hours and slots, as well as how to set limitations.

### Step 5: Answer booking questions for pets and pet parents

In diverse business situations, the information you'll need to gather during the online booking process can vary widely. Whether it's vaccine records, grooming preferences, or health-related notes for your furry clients, MoeGo's adaptable booking system enables you to tailor your questionnaires to suit the unique needs of both pets and their owners.

### Step 7: Payment requirement 

**What your customer will see: Adding a card to the client file.**

Adding a card to a client's file guarantees that you will still receive your deserved revenue in case of last-minute cancellations or no-shows. It also streamlines the payment process, making transactions swift, secure, and hassle-free. To seamlessly integrate saved cards during the booking process, allowing your customers to breeze through reservations without the hassle of re-entering payment details, follow these steps: [Save cards during the booking process](__GHOST_URL__/5-ways-to-add-cards-on-file/).
