Get more 5-star reviews on Yelp, Facebook, and Google

When it comes to new clients, nothing says more about your business than the customer reviews on your profile. Many times, it’s the first place people check, even before looking over your prices. Clearly, the more reviews you have the better.

According to the report, as many as 90% of potential customers were affected by a business’s positive online reviews, and 86% were impacted by negative online reviews.

So here are** 4 steps** to get more positive reviews:

1. Provide great service, yes as you always do, to both pet owners and their lovely pets.
2. After checking out the appointment, ask about how they liked your service. And let your clients know how important their review will be to your business, particularly the ones who loved your service.
3. Before the end of the day, push "Review Booster" auto message to motivate your client to reply. MoeGo Review Booster lets you only ask for reviews from happy customers, but have a second chance to talk with unhappy customers before they post any negative reviews on social media.  (click here to learn [how MoeGo Review Booster works](https://help.moego.pet/en/articles/1025188-review-booster).)
4. Follow up with happy clients if they forgot to write a review on the link you sent.
