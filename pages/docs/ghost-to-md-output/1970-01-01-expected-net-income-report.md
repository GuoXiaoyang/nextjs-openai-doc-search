By clearly explaining each fee and how it's calculated, MoeGo Pay aims to make financial processes easy to understand for you. 

## Key Components

The statement about 'Convenience fee - processing fee' can be optimized to address the three standard scenarios:1. Processing Fee Balance < 0: The Business covers a small portion of the processing fee2. Processing Fee Balance = 0: Earn full ticket amount (default)3. Processing Fee Balance > 0: Set a high rate, the positive part will become an extra income for the businessNotice: When the user chooses the processing fee by client calculation method as ‘Earn full ticket amount (default)’:- If tips are not included, the processing fee balance will equate to 0, since the convenience fee is calculated based on the paid amount of the invoice, which at this point does not include the tip. The processing fee is also calculated without including the tip.- If the customer adds a tip after 'Take payment,' the processing fee calculation will be based on the amount of transactions, including the tip, making the processing fee larger than the convenience fee. This is because the convenience fee is always calculated on the original base amount of the invoice, so the processing fee balance will be less than 0 in this scenario.- If the customer adds a tip to the invoice before 'Take payment,' then the convenience fee calculation will be based on the invoice's paid amount that includes the tip. In this case, the processing fee will equal the convenience fee, and the processing fee balance will also be 0.Expected Net incomeNet income amount that the merchant should receive for payment transactions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: If a MoeGo Pay user has not set a processing fee by client, what should be the value they see?**

**A: **If no processing fee by client is set by the MoeGo Pay user, the convenience fee will be displayed as 0, and the processing fee balance will be equal to the processing fee. 

**Q: What are the three scenarios of processing fee by client that lead to different cases of Processing Fee Balance?**

**A:** On the card processing page where users set the processing fee by client, they can adjust the rate and choose different calculation logic, leading to varying results in the processing fee balance. 

1) When "Earn full ticket amount" (default) is selected, the fee by client will offset the processing fees (if the user does not add a tip after 'Take payment'). 

2) If the option "Charge clients the processing rate by the setting" is chosen, the processing fee balance will be less than 0, meaning that the client needs to bear a portion of the processing fee proportionally. 

3) When a client adjusts the fee by client rate higher than the original setting, the processing fee balance will be more than the actual processing fee charged in the transaction. This excess amount then becomes additional income for the business.

**Q: Is the Net Income equivalent to the Payout Amount?**

**A:** The Net Income is not necessarily the same as the Payout Amount. Net income typically refers to the total earnings after deducting all expenses, fees, and taxes associated with a business's operations, including processing fees. On the other hand, the payout amount is the actual amount paid out to a business or individual after all deductions are made from the gross income. While related, these two numbe can differ due to various adjustments and deductions applied before the final payout is calculated.
