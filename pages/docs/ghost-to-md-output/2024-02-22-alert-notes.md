The alert note serves as a distinctive type of ticket comment. Upon completion, a red exclamation mark will prominently display on the appointment card, catching your attention. To view the note, hover your mouse over it on the desktop version, or click on the exclamation mark to instantly reveal the details.

In the old version, it's called **Notice**.
