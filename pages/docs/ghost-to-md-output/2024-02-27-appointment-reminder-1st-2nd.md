## 3 Types of Appointment Reminders

### First unconfirmed appointment reminder

This message will only be sent if the appointment status is **unconfirmed**.

- If the tag **Reply Y Confirm** is added, when clients reply with** “Yes” **or** “Y”**, the appointment status will be updated to **confirmed** automatically. 
- If the tag **Reply N Cancel** is added, when the clients reply with** “No” **or **“N”**, the appointment will be **canceled** automatically.

### Second unconfirmed appointment reminder

This message will only be sent to clients who **did not confirm** their appointment after receiving the initial appointment reminder message.

The functionality of the second unconfirmed appointment reminder mirrors that of the first reminder. The only difference lies in the timing of its delivery, as the second reminder must be sent after the first reminder. 

### General reminder for both confirmed and unconfirmed appointments

The 3rd reminder offers greater flexibility compared to the unconfirmed appointment reminder. Unlike its counterpart, the general reminder can be sent at any time, irrespective of the send time settings of the other two reminders. 

It's designed to be versatile, allowing it to be dispatched even when an appointment is already confirmed. Accidents happen, and schedules may need adjusting, even after confirmation. With the appointment reminder, it's easy to double-check at the last minute and ensure everything is on track.

## FAQ

**Q1. If a client's preference is to receive the appointment reminder by call, how does that process work? Will a voicemail be left if the client does not answer the call?**

Answer: The basic rules for appointment reminders by call are to press 1 to confirm and press 2 to cancel  (the reminder rules on variables will be the same as attached). 

**Please note:**

- Verbally saying 1 or 2 won’t work
- Press 1 or 2 during the voice playing will work
- Once the voice has stopped, the call will end shortly after
- This is a robot call and will not leave a voicemail

**Q2. Can I select more than one preference for the client to receive the appointment reminders?**

Answer: Yes, you can definitely set up the client preference with multiple options. Simply select all the apply by marking the checkbox next to each preference.
