# Smart scheduling for online booking 

## How does it work for online booking?

With smart scheduling enabled for online booking, when your client book online, your availability to your client will **be filtered **to only show the time spots that are within your range.

**Note**: 
Turn on "Smart scheduling" might result in a situation of "There is availability on my calendar, but my client doesn't have that option".

For instance, if your **“maximum driving distance” is 5 miles, “maximum driving time” is 10mins**, you can expect all of your booking requests will be less than 5 miles or 10mins driving from an existing appointment on your calendar.

You can always customize the “Maximum driving distance” and “Maximum driving time” to your needs.
