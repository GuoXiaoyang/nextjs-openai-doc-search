### Part 1 - Agreement Template

We will do our best to make the appointment joyful and as stress-free as possible, not just for your dog but also for you. Please read the following policies carefully before booking a grooming appointment with us.

**1. Cancellations**

We understand that appointments occasionally need to be cancelled or rescheduled due to other events or conflicts. We require at least 48 hours notice prior to the appointment to cancel or reschedule to avoid a cancellation fee.

- Cancellations or Rescheduling with less than 48 hours notice will be charged 50% of the reserved service amount.
- Cancellations or Rescheduling with less than 24 hours notice will be charged 100% of the reserved service amount. 

**2. No-Shows**

It is considered a "no-show" when the client is not available at the scheduled appointment time and does not contact the groomer to cancel or reschedule.

- We reserve the right to charge 100% of the reserved service amount due to the loss of revenue caused by a "no-show". Please make every effort to call and cancel or reschedule when possible to avoid such situations.
- Arriving 30 minutes late or more will be considered a “no-show” or missed appointment and may require re-scheduling.
- No Show fees must be paid prior to any future booking. 

**3. Pricing**

- All prices shown are starting prices and estimates only. Pricing is based on breed, hair length, coat condition, temperament, age, and grooming history.
- Please be advised a surcharge will apply if your dog is matted, requires extra bathing, has fleas, or has not been groomed within the recommended grooming schedule for their breed. 

**4. New Clients**

- A New Client Form should be completed by first-time clients at the time of booking. We’ll send you the link to fill out and submit online. This is to ensure we can familiarise ourselves with your furkid’s general health, any concerns you may have, and the specifics required before the appointment so that we can prepare in advance.
