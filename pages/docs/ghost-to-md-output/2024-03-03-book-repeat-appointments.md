## Repeat Series Types

### 2 Types of Repeat Series

There are two types of repeat series that you can create:

- **Repeat on Rules:** Enjoy dynamic and personalized recommendations aligned with your client's grooming preferences and visit history. Customize appointment frequency, days, and duration effortlessly for seamless scheduling.
- **Repeat on Selected Days:** Effortlessly schedule recurring appointments on designated days, allowing for personalized and convenient grooming sessions tailored to your clients' schedules. 
- üí°**Please note:** this setting functions more like bulk appointment creation. When appointments are created by selected dates, they will not be generated as part of a repeat series.

### Series that Repeat on rules

When configuring series that repeat on rules, you'll be prompted to specify:

- **Frequency (Every)/Repeat type:** Customize the repeat series frequency by days, weeks, or months.
- **Repeat/Starts on:** Select the preferred day of the week for the appointments.
- **Ends:** Determine when the repeat series concludes based on the total number of occurrences or specific dates.

## Preview & Resolve Time Conflicts

Once you've confirmed the Repeat Rules but before finalizing the repeat series booking, MoeGo provides the option to click **< Preview > **to address any potential time conflicts.

If conflicts arise, you can resolve them using one of the following methods:

- **Clicking on < Optimize with Smart Scheduling >**: This feature, powered by Smart Scheduling, attempts to resolve conflicts by considering existing appointments, blocks, and working hours. It optimizes client time preferences and your custom driving rules, such as drive time, distance, start/end location, and service areas for certain days.
- **Manually editing the date, time, or staff:** This flexible option allows you to make direct adjustments to the repeated appointment while conveniently viewing staff availability in the calendar view for quick reference.
