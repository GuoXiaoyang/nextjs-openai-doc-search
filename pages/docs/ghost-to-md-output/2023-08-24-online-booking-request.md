# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Why my clients can't find any availability when booking online? **

The availability for online booking usually depends on many factors, such as the client's address, the service duration and the staff's working hours, etc. You can go to the abandoned list to check on which step they stopped and contact them to schedule again. 

**Q2: Why did my client submit the booking request but I did not receive it on the requests page? **

Please note that only if the clients see the "submitted successfully " page will that mean the booking request is successfully submitted, then it will show on the request list.

If the clients fail to submit the card info or prepay for the request when you require it, the online booking request will not be submitted.
