Just like your mission to provide the highest quality service to your clients and pets, our top priority is to provide you with the **industry-leading platform.**

We‚Äôve rebuilt MoeGo to ensure the highest standard of reliability. We innovated solutions like Smart Scheduling, Route Optimization, 2-Way Communication, Review Booster, and Online Booking that are the first and the best in the industry. We are committed to innovating to help you thrive in new market challenges.

To reflect all of that added value and ensure that we can keep investing in innovation, we are excited to announce **the new plans** effective on **Oct 1, 2022.**

üìç *<Scroll to the end to view the new plans>*

The [previous plans](https://www.moego.pet/pricing) will be sunsetted starting Oct 1st 2022 at 00:00 PST. Here are details on what this means for customers on paid plans and users on the free version.

### Customers on paid plans

First off, we appreciate your love and support to us over the years. We will be **grandfathering** your plan, and of course, if you find that the new plans fit you better, you can switch to any of them starting Oct 1st.

- **Grandfathered plans**: All MoeGo users on paid plans before Oct 1st, 2022 at 00:00 PST will have their plans grandfathered in. This means you will get to keep your plan, including its price and features, even after the [previous plans](https://www.moego.pet/pricing) sunset on Oct 1st, as long as your plan is active. This applies to all the previous plans: Beginner, Rising Star, and Business Elite.
- **Upgrade / Downgrade**: Since the [previous plans](https://www.moego.pet/pricing) will be sunsetted when the new plans are launched, you will not be able to upgrade or downgrade from any of the previous plans starting Oct 1st. So if you want to secure one of the previous plans, including price and features, please do so before Oct 1st.
- **Features:** You will be able to access new updates and improvements on features included in your plan. For any brand new product features, we will be sure to let you know in advance which plan they‚Äôll be in.
- **Cancellation**: Once your grandfathered subscription plan is cancelled, either due to voluntary cancellation or failed payment, the grandfathered status will be lost due to the sunsetting of previous plans.
- **Expansion**: You will also be grandfathered into the previous pricing for adding new locations to your account as your business expands.

### Users on free version

- If you are considering upgrading to one of our [paid plans](https://www.moego.pet/pricing) anytime soon, it‚Äôs recommended to upgrade before Oct 1st to lock in a grandfathered plan. 
- Some features will no longer be included in the free version starting Oct 1st, including but not limited to creating repeat appointments, appointment waitlist, and Google calendar sync. We appreciate your trust to use MoeGo and we encourage you to continue using these features and more with the paid plans.

### Introducing our new plans!

The changes and thoughts behind the new plans:

- **Unique plans:** As we talked with many mobile and salon business owners in the past few years, we learned that the operations and challenges of each business are very different. We are going to focus on building dedicated solutions for each business type, and offering unique plans allow us to invest in future development to continuously empower both mobile and salon.
- **More options to choose from: **We want to make sure you can always find the right solutions, regardless of which business stage you are in. Outgrowing a platform and having to leave is a pain, and our goal is to make sure you feel confident you can build the business of their dreams. Whether you are starting a new grooming business or you are rapidly growing, there will be a plan fit for you.
- **Unlimited auto messages: **We‚Äôve heard so many of our customers say things like ‚Äúgoing text communication has completely changed my business, and my customers are much happier.‚Äù As the most highly requested feature, we are so glad to bring it to life! The Ultimate plans will allow businesses to send unlimited auto messages to their clients now.
- **Price change: **You‚Äôll also notice a price adjustment to our plans as well. This will help our company better reflect the value that we bring to our customers. It will also allow us to invest even more into product innovation and our customer service (we‚Äôre the only 24/7 support in the pet industry!).

### What‚Äôs next?

In the coming months, we‚Äôll be adding new features that our customers have been asking for, including the client membership system, the brand-new online booking experience, and much more. Stay in the loop because we have tons of exciting stuff on our product roadmap!

We seriously couldn‚Äôt have gotten here without all of your support. Thanks for trusting us to be the partner of your pawsome business. To us, our biggest accomplishment is that we have a community of over 6000 and growing fast.

We thrive when you thrive ‚ù§Ô∏è
