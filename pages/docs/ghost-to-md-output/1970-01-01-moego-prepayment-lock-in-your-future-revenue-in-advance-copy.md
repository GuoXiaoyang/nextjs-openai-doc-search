MoeGo Prepayment allows you to require your clients to prepay for their appointments. A perfect solution for drastically reducing no-shows, improving your cash flows, and automating the payment process.

## How MoeGo Prepayment Works

MoeGo Prepayment allows businesses to secure payment for service **upon online booking. **And the businesses will receive the deposit or even the full amount **as soon as the appointment is accepted.**

**Step 1: Enable prepayment and decide how you want to set up your prepay requirements.**

**Step 2: Customers prepay when submitting an online booking request.**

*The prepaid amount will be held in the client's bank account.

**Step 4: The business accepts the booking request**

*The prepaid amount will be transferred to the business' bank account.

**Also, you need to know before enabling the prepayment:**

- If you do not approve an appointment request before the holding period expires, the prepayment amount will be fully released to the client.
- Standard card processing fees apply and will be deducted from the prepaid amount.
- A booking fee, ranging from $1 to $3 depending on the required prepayment amount, will apply to the clients' online booking requests and will be paid by the clients. The booking fee is non-refundable unless you decline an appointment request or refund the full amount of a client's prepayment.

## Option 1: MoeGo Prepayment with deposit by percentage

This will work if your ticket prices have a wide range, so you want to make sure your clients have the right commitment.

**Step 1: Choose < Partial amount (Deposit) >**

The prepaid amount is calculated on the actual price of the service in the service menu or the saved price for clients. If it is not the final full price of the ticket, you can charge the remaining when clients check out.

**Step 2: Choose < by percentage >**

**Step 3: Set the percentage**

The deposit amount is the set percentage of the total service price. For example, if the ticket amount is $100, the percentage is 30%, and the deposit amount is $30.

**Step 4: Input your cancellation policy**

## Option 2: MoeGo Prepayment with deposit by amount

This will be good if your prices are pretty much close or prefer consistency in deposit management.

**Step 1: Choose < Partial amount (Deposit) >**

The prepaid amount is calculated on the actual price of the service in the service menu or the saved price for clients. If it is not the final full price of the ticket, you can charge the remaining when clients check out.

## Option 3: MoeGo Prepayment with full payment

This will be ideal if you prefer to collect payments in advance and save time at checkout.

## **Frequently asked questions**

**Q1: If I turn it on, does it automatically apply to all appointments for all clients?**

Yes, once itâ€™s turned on, all clients will need to prepay a certain amount when they submit an online booking request. The exact amount will depend on your settings.

**Q2: Will clients have the option to tip?**

If you turn on the partial amount (deposit) required, clients will not be asked to tip for the deposit payment. When you finish the service and check out, clients will then be able to tip as normal.

If you turn on the full payment required, you can turn on/off tipping option at bookings. Youâ€™re always able to collect tips later.

**Q3: Can I request a deposit and card on file at the same time?**

If you turn on prepayment, clients will be able to save their cards for future use when they pay. Once they check this box, the card info will be encrypted and saved under their card on file section.

**Q4: When will the deposit or prepayments go to my account?**

Once the booking request is scheduled, the fund will be captured and transferred to the connected account. The payout will be every 2 business days rolling basis for U.S. users.

**Q5: Do I have to schedule booking requests to get the payments transferred to my account?**

Yes, if the booking request is not accepted before the hold period expires, the fund will be released to your customer. The holding period may be up to 2 days depending on the card issuers' policy.

If the request hasnâ€™t been scheduled when it expires, customers will see the original authorization drop off their statement entirely after a few days. There will be no payment and no refund.

**Q6: What if I decline the booking request?**

If the booking request is declined, customers will see their prepayment drop off after a few days. 

**Q7: Can I decline the request but hold the payment for future appointments?**

This isnâ€™t available at the moment. Our product team will launch a client credit feature in the future to support the need for â€˜pay now, use laterâ€™.

**Q8: Why the booking fee varies?**

Multiple factors will be considered when calculating the actual booking fee of the specific online booking request. The booking fee will vary based on the extra cost incurred and the risk associated with the transaction.
