The processing fee can now be easily added to the invoice at checkout in MoeGo. It consists of two parts, a percentage and a fixed amount for each transaction, both of which can be passed to the client's side. Once configured the fee rate, the exact fees will be calculated for transactions automatically and ready to be applied at checkout. 

**How to set it up**

1. Go to **card processing > Stripe integration > payment preference**
2. Select paid by clients and sign the agreement
3. Customize the fee name, configure percentage and flat amount for transactions
