# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does the counter-dispute process work in MoeGo?**

**A:** In MoeGo, the support team actively gathers necessary evidence and submits it on your behalf to counteract disputes. Typically, banks decide within 1-2 months. You can track the status of disputes through the path **Payment settings > MoeGo Pay > Transaction Activity > Dispute **on the App or **Card processing > Transaction activity > Dispute** on the Desktop Web Version. The evidence includes service details, receipts, your communication with clients, and signed agreements. You're encouraged to provide any additional evidence that may support your case.

**Q: What exactly is an inquiry?**

**A:** An inquiry is a preliminary step some card networks take before proceeding to a formal dispute and chargeback. This phase, referred to as an "inquiry," "retrieval," or "request for information" by Stripe, is commonly used by American Express and Discover. Mastercard and Visa no longer utilize this phase. It involves the cardholder's bank seeking clarification on a transaction, often because the cardholder does not recognize the transaction details. Resolving an inquiry effectively, either by providing sufficient evidence to address the dispute or by issuing a full refund, can prevent a dispute fee. Note that inquiries on transactions that have been partially refunded may still escalate to a chargeback.
