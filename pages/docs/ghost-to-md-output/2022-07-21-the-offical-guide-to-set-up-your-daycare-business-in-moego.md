## Setting up kennels and staff

⭐

Set up staff profiles to manage your kennels' appointments and their calendar view.

1. Go to MoeGo Desktop > Settings > Staff, create a role named ‘Kennel’ by clicking on** Role settings**. 
2. Create a staff to use as kennels by clicking on **+ Add new staff **and select 'Kennel' role. 
3. We recommend using one staff profile to manage multiple kennels to simplify this setup process. You can decide the number of kennels managed by one profile according to your total number of kennels and your device size. Feel free to play around with this number and how zoom in/out your phone, tablet, or browser is. For the purpose of this guide, let's manage 5 kennels with each profile. 
4. (Optional) If you have other staff whose profiles have not been created in MoeGo, create their staff profiles by clicking on **+ Add new staff **and select their respective roles. You can then schedule their appointments after the profiles are created, and manage them alongside your kennels.

## Setting up daycare online booking portal

⭐

Set up an online booking website to allow clients to request daycare and other service bookings based on kennel capacity, pending requests, and existing appointments.

1. Go to MoeGo Desktop > Online booking > Settings, under **Available time**, click on Availability type, choose By slots.
2. Set up a slot for each kennel staff at your desired drop off time of capacity 5 (As mentioned in *setting up kennels and staf*f, our example uses one staff profile to manage 5 kennels. You can set up this number based on your needs). This will allow you to accept 5 pets at one drop-off time. (Note: Manually creating appointments at slot time will take up the availability accordingly).
3. Under Time slot format, choose whether you want to offer an exact drop off time or a time window. This format will appear on your customer’s end when they pick an appointment time on your online booking calendar.
