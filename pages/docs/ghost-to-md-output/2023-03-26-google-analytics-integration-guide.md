# Set up your report

You can explore and set up analytics report based on data collected by your GA ID.

Letâ€™s take funnel report by page path for example.

Page path for key steps in booking flow:

Start booking - `/ol/book`

Select service - `/ol/service/choose`

Select groomer - `/ol/groomer/choose`

Select time - `/ol/time`

Submit booking - `/ol/appointment/submitted`
