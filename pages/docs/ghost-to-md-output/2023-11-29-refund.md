Refund is a common business practice that maintains customer satisfaction. MoeGo allows you to perform both full refunds and itemized partial refunds to ensure a streamlined refund process.

## How refund works in MoeGo

Refund needs to be handled properly to ensure reporting accuracy. There are 2 steps to ensure the refund gets reflected correctly in the reports, and we strongly recommend completing both steps to avoid discrepancies in your report.

#### **Step 1: Issuing** a **refund to your client**

Payment received will be decreased and the invoice will be reopened with outstanding balances.

#### Step 2: Updating the original sale

Update the original sale to resolve the outstanding balance, which leads to two types of refund:

a. Service item refunds: Decreasing the expected revenue by editing items on the invoice. 

b. Payment-only refunds: Charge again for the outstanding balance

## Types of Refund

### Type 1: Service item refunds

Edit invoice to issue service item refunds. Customers will have no outstanding payments for the services/items, ensuring that the invoice remains closed and that the charges are excluded from your revenue reports.

Service items includes service & add-on price, service charge, product price, tip, and discount on the invoice.

### Type 2: Payment-only refunds

Customers still have outstanding balances for the services/items, which will reopen the invoice and require payment from the customer.
