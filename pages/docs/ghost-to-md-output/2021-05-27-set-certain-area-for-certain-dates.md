Visualize your area planning in the mobile app

"Set a certain area for certain dates" is one of the features MoeGo developed especially to empower mobile groomers. As a mobile groomer, you don't want to drive all around during the day. You have your plans when to go where. So we built this feature to enable you to** visualize your area planning in the mobile app**.

## Integrate with Online booking

Once set up (the set up is only available through MoeGo mobile app), you can even incorporate this setting into your online booking. 

With Certain Area for Certain Dates enabled in Online booking, **clients from a certain area will only be able to book with you on certain days**. 

You can simply turn on "certain area for certain days" under online booking > mobile grooming setting.
