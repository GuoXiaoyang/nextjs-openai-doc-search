This message will be sent only if the appointment status is “**unconfirmed**”.

- If the tag **“Reply Y Confirm”** is added, when clients replied with** “Yes” or “Y”**, the appointment status will be updated to “**confirmed**” automatically. 
- If the tag **“Reply N Cancel”** is added, when the clients replied with** “No” or “N”**, the appointment will be **canceled** automatically.

## 2nd unconfirmed appt reminder

The 2nd unconfirmed appt reminder functions the same as the 1st appt reminder. The only difference is the "when to send", the 2nd reminder has to be after the 1st reminder.

## 3rd reminder for any appointments

The 3rd reminder is the more flexible version of a reminder. Unlike the unconfirmed appt reminder, the appointment reminder can be sent **anytime **regardless of the send time setting of the other two reminders.

The appointment reminder can be sent even when an appointment is already confirmed.  Accident happens and sometimes people need to change their schedule even they already have confirmed an appointment. So it never hurts to double-check at the last minute. The appointment reminder will do the trick.

1. Go to **<Setting>** on the side menu bar
2. Click **<Auto message>**
3. Switch the** <toggle>** under control to turn on or off **Appointment reminder**
4. Click on a message to <**edit>** it
5. Under When to send, edit triggering conditions for sending a reminder
