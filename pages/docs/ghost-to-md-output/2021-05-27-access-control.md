You can customize staff roles & permissions

### What's new: 

In the older version, only the Owner and Admin role can log in from the desktop. Now in the MoeGo2.0, staff can also log in from the desktop with controlled access. 

In the older version, there are preset roles of Groomer and Groomer Pro. Now In MoeGo2.0, you can add a new role, and customize their permissions.
