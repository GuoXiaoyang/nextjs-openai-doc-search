# How to edit QuickBooks sync setting

You can decide when and how your data should be synced

1. Go to **<Quickbook sync>**
2. Click the **<toggle>** to turn on or off auto QuickBooks sync based on your needs. Once it's turned on, your data will always be synced to QuickBooks.
3. Edit Synced start date to decide what data will be synced. For example, if you set synced start date to 09/01/2021, then only data starting September 9, 2021, will be synced. None of the data before this data will be synced.
4. Edit Synced Quickbooks account to decide the destination account to be synced to.
