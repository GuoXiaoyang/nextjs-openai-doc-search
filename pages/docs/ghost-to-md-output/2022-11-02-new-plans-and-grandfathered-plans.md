### How to add a new location/mobile van or change plans

Your subscription plans can be flexibly changed anytime during a subscription, no matter whether you'd like to add another location, or switch to another plan that works better for you on your account page.

### How my billing will work if the subscription changes

**1. Upgrade to a higher plan**

It will be effective right after the successful payment. The payment will be the prorated charge (difference between remaining time on new plan and unused time on previous plan). The added SMS will also be the prorated amount. 

For example, if a mobile Starter account upgrades to mobile Growth with 15 days remaining for the current billing cycle:

- the prorated payment will be $99 * 15/30 - $49 * 15/30 = $25 
- the added SMS will be 15/30 * (900-300) = 300
- then the next payment on the billing date will be the full amount of $99 with 900 SMS

**2. Add a new business unit**

It will be effective right after the successful payment. The payment will be the prorated charge. 

p.s. Grandfathered users need to contact support to add a business unit. 

**3. Downgrade to a lower plan**

It will be effective from the next billing cycle. The next payment on the billing date will be the new subscription charge. 

### What if the payment fails on the billing date

Customers have a 7-day grace period. If payments fail on the billing date, the grace period will allow users to delay payment for at most seven days to update billing info or change their billing cards. However, the account will be locked, and features will not be accessible until the payment goes through successfully. No late fees will be charged for a grace period. 

If payments haven't gone through successfully during the grace period, account subscriptions will be canceled automatically, and features will not be accessible anymore. 

### Add Backup Card to Secure Your Subscription

In case of any failed payments or card issues holding you back from day-to-day tasks, you can add a backup card to your account.

The backup card can be set as the primary card, or removed at any time you want. Avoid unexpected interruptions caused during the renewal of your subscription!

Go to my account > credit card, to add a backup card.
