## FAQ

**1. Is this accessible for my employees as well?**

The commission settings are available to owner account only. The payroll report can be viewed if the access for report section is turned on, in role permissions > can access report. 

**2. How does discount calculate for the commissions?**

The applied discount will not be taken into account when calculating commissions. In other words, the commissions will be calculated on the original service price before the discount. 

**3. How does package count in the payroll?**

If you check out using package, this ticket will not be included in the payroll for the employees.
