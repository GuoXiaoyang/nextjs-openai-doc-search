# How message is counted?

- 1 SMS message contains 160 characters
- Large messages are segmented into 153 character segments and sent individually
- Messages containing any UCS-2 characters (such as Chinese script) are limited to 70 characters and will be concatenated into 67 character message segments, even if the messages contain fewer than 160 characters
