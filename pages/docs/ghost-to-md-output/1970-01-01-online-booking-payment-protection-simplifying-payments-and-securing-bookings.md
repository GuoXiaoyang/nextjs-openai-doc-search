No-shows and failed card charges can really mess up daily work in the grooming industry. By setting up MoeGo's Online Booking Payment protection, you can cut down on these problems a lot. You can either get a deposit early or automatically check that the client’s card is applicable to use during online booking. With MoeGo Pay, both you and your clients can have an easy and smooth online booking and checkout process, with all the tough parts handled by us.

# 1. Setting up your Online Booking Payment Protection

You can set up different protection methods for your online booking slots and payment by going to **Online Booking > Setting  > Payment.**

# 2. Ways to protect your Online Booking Payment

## 1) Asking for Prepayment or Deposit

By selecting **< Prepayment / Deposit >**, customers must pay a deposit or even the total amount before submitting an online booking request. You will decide how you want to set up your prepay requirements.

When a customer submits the booking and pays the prepaid amount, the payment will be frozen in the client's bank account. Once the business accepts the booking request, the prepaid amount will be transferred to the business' bank account.

## 2) MoeGo Pay Pre-auth( Coming soon )

With the new MoeGo Pay Pre-auth feature, the required payment can be securely reserved on the client's card 48 hours before the appointment, ensuring a 100% funding guarantee without any actual money being deducted. In case of any failure, there is a 48-hour grace period to fill up the appointment slot.

## 3) Require card on file

By selecting **< Require card on file >**， your clients will be asked to add a card to their profile during the online booking process. It guarantees that you still earn your revenue when last-minute cancellations and no-shows happen.

To make sure that all the cards add to the files are available to use, we suggest that you turn on the Card Authentication protection so that the frozen and outdated cards will not be allowed to be added to the client profile. [Click Here](__GHOST_URL__/moego-pay-card-authentication/) for detailed instructions for setting up MoeGo Pay Card Authentication.

## 4) Disable payment

By selecting** <Disable Payment>**, the clients will not be asked to add any payment info or make any prepayments during the online booking process.

# 3. Frequently asked question

**Q1. Are those Online Booking Payment protection methods applicable to all MoeGo Users?**

They are available to MoeGo Pay users only! [Click here](__GHOST_URL__/set-up-moego-pay/) for an instruction to set up MoeGo Pay.

**Q2. Is there any additional charge for Prepayment?**

Standard card processing fees apply and will be deducted from the prepaid amount.

MoeGo will charge a booking fee (ranging from $1 to $3 depending on your required prepayment amount) from your clients in addition to the prepayment amount when your clients submit online booking requests. The booking fee is non-refundable unless you decline an appointment request or refund the full amount of a client's prepayment, in which cases the booking fee will be refunded.
