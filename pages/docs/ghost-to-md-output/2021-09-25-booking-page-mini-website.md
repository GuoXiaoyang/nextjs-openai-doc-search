Online booking is one of the most powerful and unique tools MoeGo offers. It's basically a mini-website that can serve branding and booking purposes. If you don't have a website yet, online booking will do the job.

If you have your own website already, you can also embed online booking directly into it.

## Get the booking link or embed online booking into your website

You can embed your online booking website onto your existing website in the following two ways. **We highly recommend you hyperlink elements on your website with your MoeGo Online Booking Link (the first approach illustrated below).** If you choose to embed MoeGo Online Booking with HTML codes(the second approach illustrated below), compatibility issues may arise depending on the builder you use.

Under **Online booking**, go to booking channels. Then you can choose **"Book now direct link" **or** "Embed online booking"**

### (Recommended) Non-technical solution - Book now direct link

**Hyperlink text/images/button on your website with your MoeGo Booking Link.**

1. **Copy **your own MoeGo Booking Link
2. Paste the Booking Link on your website to a button, or text, or image.

### Slightly more technical solution - Embed online booking

### Using a website builder

Most website builders will have an HTML/Embed widget that you can drag and drop on your webpage. 

1. Booking channels > Embed online booking > Get code > Copy code

2. Open the HTML file of the webpage to which youâ€™d like to add the booking widget. Paste the code where you want the button to appear.

3. Save the file to your server and youâ€™re done!
