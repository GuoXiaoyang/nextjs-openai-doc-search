Also, you can show the color code with **"Service color"** or **"Appointment color"**. 

Note:

- Color code can adjust as **"service color"** or **"appointment color"** depends on your will
- To set up **appointment color**, go to appointment detail > color code
- To set up **service color**, go to setting > services
- When service color is selected, if one ticket has multiple services, only the **first service color** will be applied
