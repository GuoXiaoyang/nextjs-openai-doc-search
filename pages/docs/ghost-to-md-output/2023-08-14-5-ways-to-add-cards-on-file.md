## **‚ùì Frequently asked question**

**Q1. Is it safe to save card info on MoeGo?**

The card info will be saved on the current primary payment processor. Rest assured that we prioritize the highest standards of security and compliance, employing robust encryption protocols and adhering to industry regulations. You can trust that your customer‚Äôs payment data is in safe hands.

**Q2. Is there any area limitations for the card-on-file feature?**

It is only available for those areas that support the payment processor. While Stripe is available in the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia, card-on-file is supported in these areas.

But for the UK users who enable care authorization, the card may fail to be saved due to the 3DS issue. Click [here](__GHOST_URL__/moego-pay-card-authentication/) to know more details about it.

**Q3. Can a client add another card if they have an existing card on file through the intake form?**

The new card won't be added if there is already an existing card on file.

**Q4. Can my clients quick-scan the card number when filling out the card info?**

This is available for iOS device users. Click on the autofill button and use camera.

**Q5. Can I transfer the card info saved to another processor?**

Since the card info is encrypted by each processor, it is not possible to transfer the card info.

**Q6. If I switch from one processor to another, will the card-on-file requirement for online booking prompt existing customers to input a new card again?**

Yes, it will require customers to input a new card.
