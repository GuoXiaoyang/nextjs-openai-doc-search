Pricing for pets is difficult, it depends on the breed, the size, the weight, the last service date, how well the pet behave etc etc.. One service menu cannot fit all, so we have the feature that you can 'save price for specific pet'.

# What do I use it for?

- You can save the **<Duration>** and** <Price> **of a specific service for the pet.
- The next time you select the service, the **<Saved duration>** and **<Price>** will automatically fill up for the pet
