## FAQ

**Q1. How do the driving rules affect Smart Scheduling?**

Answer: The driving rules are **the maximum driving distance OR time you would accept between appointments.**

Example:

If you have set up "10 miles, 15 mins" for the parameters, we will only suggest the time slots that are either within 10 miles or 15 mins, from the previous, or to the next appointment.
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-20-at-15.20.32@2x.png)
**Q2. What is the start location and how does it affect Smart Scheduling?**

Answer: The start location can be your home address, or wherever your mobile van is parked at.

For a day that's wide open from the beginning of the day, we will suggest the first time slot based on the parameters between the "new location" and the "start location".

Example:

For a day that starts at 9 AM, if the "new appointment" address is close enough to the "start location", MoeGo will suggest that time slot.

*** Please note**: if you leave the start location empty, MoeGo will not consider the parameters between the "new location" and the "start location", and will suggest all dates that have the first time slot available.

**Q3. What is the end location and how does it affect Smart Scheduling?**

Answer: It can be your home address, or wherever your mobile van is parked at.

Once you have the "end location" in place, we will still suggest a time slot if it is "very far" from the previous appointment, but "very close" to the end location where your mobile van will park.

Example:

Even if the new address is 25 mins driving distance from the last appointment, we will still recommend this time slot, since it is only 5 mins to your end location.
![](https://cdn.moego.pet/w3/go/v2/static/media/ic-smart-scheduling-end-address.a13685c9.png)
***Please note: **If you leave this empty, we will not consider the parameters between the "new location" and the "end location".

**Q4. What if I don't set the start or end location and leave it empty? How does that affect Smart Scheduling?**

Answer: If there is no start/end location, any address can be scheduled when using smart scheduling.

If there is no start/end location, **but at least one existing appointment on that day**: The new address must meet the smart scheduling parameter with the existing appointment.
