Determining pricing for pets can be challenging, as it varies based on factors such as breed, size, weight, last service date, and the pet's behavior, among others. Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all service menu isn't practical, we've introduced the 'save price for specific pet' feature.

This feature allows you to save a special **duration** and **price** of a specific service for each pet. The next time you select the service for that pet, the saved duration and price will automatically populate, saving you time and ensuring consistent pricing for individual pets based on their unique characteristics.
