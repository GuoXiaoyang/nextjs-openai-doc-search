## Part 1 How to manage the product list

### 1.1 Add a product

- Enter a product `Name` , `Retail price` , The definitions for SKU, Handle and Barcode for a product are as follows:

SKU (Stock keeping unit): This is a unique product code you can come up with for you and your staff to track products within your business.

Barcode: Also known as the Universal Product Code(UPC), this is the barcode printed in each product which varies from one product variant to another and in most cases a unique code globally containing 8-14 digits. If any of your products donâ€™t have a barcode printed on the packaging, you can leave the â€˜Barcode' field empty. Once you fill in the barcode your product is ready for scanning while selling it.

Tips: you can scan the barcode on your product through a barcode scanner on this page, it will automatically fill in the Barcode field
