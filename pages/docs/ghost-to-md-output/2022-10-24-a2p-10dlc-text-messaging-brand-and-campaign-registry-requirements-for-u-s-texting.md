A2P 10DLC Requirements for U.S. Texting

MoeGo offers every business with a unique phone number as your **MoeGo number**. The MoeGo number allows you to send business text messages to your customers. Messages like this are regulated and require to be registered. For businesses in the U.S., MoeGo has done all the registrations last year. 

However, on Sep 28th, 2022, ¬†[TCR](https://www.campaignregistry.com/) launched an updated version of registration requirements.** Businesses that don‚Äôt meet the new requirements and all new businesses upgraded after Sep 28th will need to submit this registration.**

This is the regulation for all software providers who provide A2P 10DLC message services. The numbers that don‚Äôt comply the regulations will experience message being filtered or blocked by carrier, and penalties of increasing message fees.

But don‚Äôt worry! MoeGo has been working closely with the vendor, and have developed the registration process within the software so you can register it easily. 

## What is A2P 10DLC?

These new registration requirements are referred to as ‚ÄúA2P 10DLC‚Äù because they relate to Application-to-Person (A2P) type messaging sent via standard 10-digit long code (10DLC) phone numbers.

This is relevant for all businesses in MoeGo that will send SMS messages to numbers in the U.S.

**Businesses outside the U.S. won‚Äôt be affected.**

## 
What is the TCR (The Campaign Registry)?

[**The Campaign Registry**](https://www.campaignregistry.com/) is a central hub for registering A2P 10DLC messaging brands and campaigns. They will verify your business, so your messages don‚Äôt get filtered by carriers. They are a conduit between your business and mobile carriers.

MoeGo will be your single point of contact to register your businesses. You do not need to be in contact with the TCR directly.

## What happens if I don‚Äôt register?

Your message traffic may be subject to heavier carrier filtering - which means your customers might have issues receiving reminders, auto messages, 2-way messages, and mass text.

**And since all messages sent through unregistered businesses will incur increased per-message carrier fees, the SMS amount included in your subscription may be reduced by half if registration is not completed within 1 month after you receive the [action required] notification in the account.**

At a future date, unregistered text messaging in the U.S. via 10-digit long code numbers may not be supported at all.
