The infrastructures at US cell carriers weren't built to handle the level of fraudulent calls and texts that occur today. So the major US carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon) are working together and introducing a new industry-wide text message regulation. **All US businesses using MoeGo to send texts to any US number must complete the US carrier registration.**

This guide is for US customers to complete your registration. We have simplified the registration process with our vendor and will guide you through it, and you'll benefit from better deliverability and faster message throughput.

If you are interested in learning more about all the details that we take care for you behind the scenes, read this article by [Twilio on A2P 10DLC](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260800720410-What-is-A2P-10DLC-#h_01EX7FWDJ2AN93ZCCYBB17DS66).

### How do I register?

To register, if you have a valid EIN for your business, check out [here](__GHOST_URL__/a2p-10dlc-text-messaging-brand-and-campaign-registry-requirements-for-u-s-texting/#complete-us-carrier-registration-for-business-with-an-ein)

If you're a small business, sole proprietor, or other type of business that does not have a valid EIN, check out [here](__GHOST_URL__/a2p-10dlc-text-messaging-brand-and-campaign-registry-requirements-for-u-s-texting/#complete-us-carrier-registration-for-business-without-an-ein)

Only a business owner's account will have access to the message registration in MoeGo.

For newly upgraded customers, you will need to register with the US carriers after the first month to prevent high filter rate.

#### How much does registration cost?

After you've submitted the form, we will pass your form details along to a third-party organization, [The Campaign Registry (TCR)](https://www.campaignregistry.com/), for review.

You will need to pay a $20 one-time registration fee. The fee goes to The Campaign Registry (TCR) and other third-party entities that help review and register your brand and campaign.

Here is more information on how these fees break down:

1. A one-time $4 fee covers the registration of your brand. A brand is your company information like name, address, EIN, etc;
2. A third-party entity collects a $15 fee to review the campaign information manually;
3. Maintaining good standing with the carriers after your campaign is approved requires a $1.50 monthly fee. Currently, MoeGo will waive the monthly recurring fees starting on the 2nd month for you.

These fees are subject to change according to The Campaign Registry (TCR). We know these fees are surprising but if it helps, think of them as a small tax to keep fraud away from telephony and help make the use of a phone as a trusted channel of communication. ðŸ˜Š
