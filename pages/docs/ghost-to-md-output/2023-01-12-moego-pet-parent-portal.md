## 
What is the Pet Parent Portal?

The Pet Parent Portal is for your customers to access all of their pet's information and appointments. It gives them the ability to have a self-serve experience. 

In the portal, clients will be able to view and manage their appointments, including booking, rescheduling, or canceling those that have not yet been confirmed by the business. They will also be able to see their upcoming and history appointments with businesses that they have visited.

## How to invite your customers to the Pet Parent Portal

Clients can access the Pet Parent Portal by using the invitation link provided by businesses. **The link is unique for each client.**

To invite your customers to the Pet Parent Portal do the following:

1. Log into your MoeGo App or Desktop. 
2. Go to the message center (you can mass text or individually invite)
3. Click on "Pet Parent Portal Invite Link"

Once the pet parent registers with the same email they use to online book, all of their information will be in their account.
