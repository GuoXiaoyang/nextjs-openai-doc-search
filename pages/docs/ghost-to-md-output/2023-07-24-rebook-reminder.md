Always have to keep an eye on which client needs to rebook? Wish to generate more revenue from an existing client? Clients always miss their regular grooming sessions?

**ðŸš© MoeGo Rebook Reminder is here to help! **

Rebook reminder is a powerful tool to help you stay organized and ensure that none of your precious clients miss out on their well-deserved grooming sessions. It also helps maintain a full grooming schedule and optimize your business's revenue potential.

Let's set up rebook reminder now!

## 1. How Rebook Reminder Works

If some customers have exceeded the grooming frequency after the last appointments, but have not yet booked new appointments, our Rebook Reminder has got your back!

With the toggle on, **reminder messages will be sent automatically at the time you set it. **

For example: 

Lily's pre-set grooming frequency is 5 weeks while her last appointment was on 01/16/2023, which means her next expected appointment should be on 02/20/2023. 

But she has not booked with you yet! If you have set the rebook reminder to send 7 days before the next appointment, a rebook reminder will be sent to her on 02/13/2023.

## 2. How To Use Rebook Reminder (Desktop)

### Step 1: Set Grooming Frequency For Your Clients

**The grooming frequency decides when the client needs to be rebooked.**

By default, the service frequency is 4 weeks. Please note that the grooming frequency is based on the clients instead of pets.

To set up grooming frequency for all clients, go to **Desktop** > **Settings** > **Business** > **Default settings**. Once set up, it will automatically apply to all **new clients.**

**<Apply to all>** It will instantly update the "Preferred frequency" for **All clients** in the list to the default value. This action CANNOT be reversed. 

*The option to set grooming frequency for all is available for the desktop version only.

To set grooming frequency for a single client on the desktop version: go to **Client profile** > **Client details** > **Grooming preference**.

You may take the actual frequency based on history as a reference when customizing grooming frequency for the client.
