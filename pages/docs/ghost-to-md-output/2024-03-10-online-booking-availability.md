## Auto-assignment of staff and time slots to requests

### Understanding Auto-Assignment

With "Date Only" or disabled Staff Selection, bookings made by clients won't have a pre-selected staff member or time slot.

The system automatically assigns the next available time slot and staff member to these bookings, marking them as pending requests.

- **Date Only with Staff**: the system will prioritize assigning **the earliest available time slot** to the groomer selected by the client.
- **Specific Time without Staff**: the system will prioritize assigning preferred groomers. If the preferred groomer is not available, it will be assigned following the sort of staff list.
- **Date Only and without Staff**: the system will first attempt to assign the booking to the **client’s preferred groomer at their earliest available time**. If the preferred groomer is not available, the system will then assign the next available groomer on the staff list who meets the criteria.

### Identifying Auto-Assigned Appointments

In your calendar view or appointment list, look for the icon indicating that the staff/time slot has been auto-assigned by the system. This icon helps in quickly recognizing appointments that need review or confirmation.
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image-1.png)
### **Reviewing and Modifying Assignments**

Click on **< Schedule >** in the pending requests list to view the auto-assigned details.

The system will tell you if any information was auto-assigned in the banner on the appointment details.
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image.png)
You can modify the:

- Time slot
- Staff member
- other details of the appointment before confirming. 

This step ensures that the assignment aligns with your scheduling needs and client preferences.

### **Confirming the Appointment**

After reviewing and adjusting the auto-assigned details, confirm the appointment. Confirmation finalizes the time slot and staff member for the client's booking.

### **Client Notifications**

Before confirming the booking, auto notifications sent to clients will not include the auto-assigned details.

Once you confirm the booking, the notification will be updated to include the final details, such as the assigned staff member and time slot.

## Troubleshooting Online booking availability

The online booking available time slots are defined by a set of settings:

- Staff available time is not available / no staff for certain services
- Closed dates / Closed holiday
- Block on the calendar / Existing appointments on the calendar
- Booking limits on the pets
- For mobile businesses with "**smart scheduling**", the availability will also be defined by your smart scheduling parameter setting, as well as how far the new appointment to your existing appointments
- For mobile businesses with a "**certain area for certain days**", the availability will also be defined by your settings of certain areas for certain dates. If you are not going to a certain area on certain dates, that date will not be available for your customers to select from

## FAQ

**Q1. Do the date overrides apply to online booking by slot？**

**Answer:** The setting of override does not affect by slot result at all. Only blocks and business closed dates can reject online booking requests when clients book by slot.

**Q2. Which plan gives you access to use these features?**

**Answer: **All plans can turn on “Sync with staff working hours” in online booking.

**Q3.****How can I prevent specific clients from being available from booking online? Is there a block list?**

**Answer: **Yes! You have the option of adding specific clients to the online booking block list. To add a client to the block list go to **online booking on the desktop > settings > clients > block list > available clients > search for the client(s) > add to block list.**

Once a client is added to the block list, they will see every day as fully booked when attempting to make an online booking request.
