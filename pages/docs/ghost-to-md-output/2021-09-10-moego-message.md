## Frequently asked questions

- **What's my phone number? **

There will be a unique number assigned to your account. Since that number won't change during your use of MoeGo service, you can actually use it as your contact number for messaging. Please note this number can be used for send and receive messages only, no phone calls are available. 

- **Does my customer need to download any apps? **

Your customers don't need to download any app, they will receive your message through a regular text message. 

- **Can I control the staff access? **

Yes! You can set up the staff access permissions, it's either no access to the message at all or limit to customers with who the staff has appointments.
