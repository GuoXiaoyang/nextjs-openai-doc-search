# Frequently asked questions

- Will my repeat appointments sync from Google Calendar to MoeGo?

We will try our best to update this feature in the near future. We suggest using repeat appointments in MoeGo.

- Once the staff has been deleted, will he/she see my appointment in Google Calendar?

No. Once the staff has been deleted, the calendar will be deleted in Google as well.

- I don't want my staff to see my clients' contact info, will my staff see it when they integrate Google Calendar with MoeGo?

Once you turn off the authority of clients' info for your staff, they will not be able to see it after the Google Calendar integration.

- Why not all of my staffs' appointments are synced to Google Calendar?

It will only sync the "Show on calendar" staff. Also, once you add more staff after the Google Calendar sync, you will need to add it in the Calendar sync setting manually. 

- Will it sync all of my appointments between MoeGo and Google Calendar?

Once you finish the Google Calendar sync, it will automatically sync the appointments within the past 3 months and the future 2 years. As time pass, the existing appointment will not disappear and the calendar will constantly sync the upcoming 2 years appointments.
