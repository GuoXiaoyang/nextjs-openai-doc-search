## What is MoeGo Prepayment

**MoeGo Prepayment **is a feature that allows businesses to secure payment for service upon booking. This helps merchants lock in future revenue in advance.

Once MoeGo Prepayment is enabled, customers must pay a deposit or even the total amount before submitting an online booking request. You will decide how you want to set up your prepay requirements.

When a customer submits the booking and pays the prepaid amount, the payment will be frozen in the client's bank account. Once the business accepts the booking request, the prepaid amount will be transferred to the business' bank account.

This feature allows businesses to receive the deposit or even the full amount as soon as the appointment is accepted.

## Why you should use MoeGo Prepayment

- Secure revenue upon booking

With early payments, youâ€™ll be covered financially based on your policy if the client cancels.

- Reduce stress from no-shows

When clients put down a deposit and have a clear idea of what to expect, theyâ€™re less likely to cancel.

- Faster checkout

Collecting payments in advance saves time especially when groomers always have their hands full.

## **Frequently asked questions**

**Q: What card process does it support?**

MoeGo Prepayment is a MoeGo Pay exclusive feature. Once you set up MoeGo Pay, and set MoeGo Pay as the primary card processor, you're ready to go! See how to [get started with MoeGo Pay](__GHOST_URL__/set-up-meogo-pay/) here. 

**Q: If I turn it on, does it automatically apply to all appointments for all clients?**

Yes, once itâ€™s turned on, all clients will need to prepay a certain amount when they submit an online booking request. The exact amount will depend on your settings.

**Q: Will clients have the option to tip?**

If you turn on the partial amount (deposit) required, clients will not be asked to tip for the deposit payment. When you finish the service and check out, clients will then be able to tip as normal.

If you turn on the full payment required, you can turn on/off tipping option at bookings. Youâ€™re always able to collect tips later.

**Q: Can I request a deposit and card on file at the same time?**

If you turn on prepayment, clients will be able to save their cards for future use when they pay. Once they check this box, the card info will be encrypted and saved under their card on file section.

**Q: When will the deposit or prepayments go to my account?**

Once the booking request is scheduled, the fund will be captured and transferred to the connected account. The payout will be every 2 days rolling basis for U.S. users.

**Q: Do I have to schedule booking requests to get the payments transferred to my account?**

Yes, if the booking request is not accepted before the hold period expires, the fund will be released to your customer. The holding period may be up to 2 days depending on the card issuers' policy.

If the request hasnâ€™t been scheduled when it expires, customers will see the original authorization drop off their statement entirely after a few days. There will be no payment and no refund.

**Q: What if I decline the booking request?**

If the booking request is declined, customers will see the original authorization drop off their statement entirely after a few days. There will be no payment and no refund.

**Q: Can I decline the request but hold the payment for future appointments?**

This isnâ€™t available at the moment. Our product team will launch a client credit feature in the future to support the need for â€˜pay now, use laterâ€™.

**Q: What is booking fee?**

By implementing the prepayment feature, a booking fee (ranging from $1-$3) will be paid by your client when submitting their online booking requests.

The booking fee will be refunded if the booking request is declined or a full refund of prepayment is initiated, while the fee is non-refundable if itâ€™s a partial refund of prepayment.
