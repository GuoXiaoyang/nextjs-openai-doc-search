One of the BIG changes from MoeGo1.0 to **MoeGo2.0**!

You can now assign **multiple staff in one ticket**. This is great if you need different staff to serve multiple pets from one client and you need to check them out altogether.

# How does it look like

Here is how it looks like on the calendar when you have multiple staff in one ticket.  Each assigned staff will have an individual appointment card with the assigned service.
