## Intake Form

Another excellent method for adding new clients to MoeGo involves leveraging the intake form feature. Clients can conveniently complete the intake form either in person or via text messaging. Upon submission of the form, seamlessly add the client from the intake form submissions view.

## Online Booking

Activate online booking for new visitors, and MoeGo seamlessly generates a new client profile upon submission of an online booking request.

## FAQ

**Q1. What if my client submits more than one intake form?**

**Answer: **If a client submits more than one intake form, you'll be able to review the new submission, and select** < Merge existing profile >**, this will update the client profile with the information from the new submission. 

*****The merge option will only appear if the intake form has the same email address/phone number as an existing client.

**Q2. What kind of information can be found in the client profile?**

**Answer: **In the client profiles, you can find client details (contacts, notes, tags, preferences, etc), pets (pet details, notes, vaccinations, medical information, photos), bookings, agreements, reviews, credit cards, payment history, and packages sold.

**Q3. I have online booking, should I also be using intake forms? **

**Answer: **Ifyou use online booking, we would suggest that you do not use intake forms as online booking can collect the same information as intake forms. Utilize intake forms when you're not using online booking or when your schedule is fully booked.
