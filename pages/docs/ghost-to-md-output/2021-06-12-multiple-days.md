Sometimes, for some recurring clients, their appointments are not in a repeating series. You can now select multiple days and add all the future appointments at once!

ðŸ’¡ Appointments created in this way are **NOT** connected as repeat series, which means changes of one of the appointments will NOT be applied to all.

If you need to create **repeated appointments**, please click [here](__GHOST_URL__/book-repeat-appointments/)
