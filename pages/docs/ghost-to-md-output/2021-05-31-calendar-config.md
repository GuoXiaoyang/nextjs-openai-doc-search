## **Frequently asked questions:**

**Q: Do the calendar configuration settings on desktop sync with the app?**

A: Yes, the settings with the same names are essentially the same. What you have set up on the app will also decide how calendar and appointment cards will be displayed on desktop, and vice versa. There are fewer options on the app however.
